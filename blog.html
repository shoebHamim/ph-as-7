  <h3>1. Difference between local storage and session storage. </h3>
  <p>-Session storage is temporary, data is stored for the duration of a session.It get expired when the browser or tab is closed.
    <br> Local Storage is somewhat permanent.It must be deleted manually. It doesn't expire on browser/page reload/restart.
  </p>
  <p>- Session storage usually stores small amount of data while local storage often stores larger amount of data. </p>
  <h3>2. Global scope Vs Block Scope.</h3>
  <p>- Global scope means the entire coding scope. Variable that is declared in global can be accessed from anywhere of the code. <br>
  On the other hand, local scope is small portion of that code like variable declared inside a function. That variable can only be accessed inside that particular function.</p>

  <h3>3. How does event loop in js work?</h3>
  <p>- JS event loop monitors the Call Stack and the Call back Queue.If the Call Stack is empty, the event loop takes the first event from the queue <br>
  and pushes it to the call stack where the event gets executed. Here Web apis helps event loop to handle asynchronous events. This is how event loop in JS works.</p>
  <h3>4. What are the ways to get undefined in JS?</h3>
  <p>- Printing a variable that has not been assigned to a value.</p>
  <p>- Function that has no return statement gives undefined.</p>
  <p>- Trying to access non-existing property of an object.</p>
  <p>- Trying to access out of index value in array.</p>
